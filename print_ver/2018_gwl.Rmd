Up to 1 million British Columbians are estimated to consume groundwater,
and hundreds of groundwater aquifers provide water for industries,
municipalities, farms, and rural homeowners in B.C. British Columbia
operates a provincial observation well monitoring network of over 180 wells, which
was established in 1961 to monitor groundwater availability in areas of
high human use.

-   Observation wells are not used for domestic or commercial use, but
instead provide information on groundwater levels over time.

-   Monitoring groundwater levels allows us to know how much groundwater
is available given human use patterns, aquifer characteristics,
weather and climate patterns.

-   This indicator presents a statistical analysis of long-term trends
in groundwater levels recorded at `r nrow(attr_wells)` observation wells 
that have been monitored for ten years or more and were active as of 2018.

-   `r round(sum(state.summary[c("Stable","Increasing"),"prop"]*100))`% of 
observation wells examined have water levels that are stable
or increasing (with `r state.summary["Increasing","n"]` wells showing 
increasing trends); `r round(state.summary["Large Rate of Decline","prop"]*100)`% 
of observation wells show a large rate of decline in water levels (more
than 10 cm per year), with a further 
`r round(state.summary["Moderate Rate of Decline","prop"]*100)`% of wells 
showing a moderate rate of decline in water levels (between 3 and 10 cm per year).

## Provincial summaries

The charts below summarise the proportions of observation wells with
groundwater levels in three long-term trend categories: large rate of
decline (more than 10 cm/year), moderate rate of decline (3 to 10
cm/year), and stable or increasing. These summaries are also presented
by region and aquifer type.

Individual well statistics
==========================

Groundwater levels are sensitive to precipitation, aquifer storage
capacity, recharge rate, and human withdrawal. Groundwater level trends
presented here indicate long-term changes in water level, but have not
been corrected for changes in precipitation patterns or other factors.
Thus, any significant trends are not necessarily directly attributable
to human use. However, information on long-term trends can be useful for
prompting further research and informing decision-making.

Appendix: Individual Groundwater Well Maps & Graphs
=========================================

Three plots were created for each well, including a map of the wellâ€™s
location (upper left).

The graph to the right of the map shows the monthly groundwater levels
relative to the annual average. This illustrates the seasonal nature of
water levels recorded in that well; many wells will have higher than
average water levels in the spring, and lower than average levels in the
late summer and fall. The shaded blue area shows the range of variation
within which 90% of observations in that month fall.

The bottom plot (called a "hydrograph") on each page shows the monthly
groundwater levels for the history of the well, with the orange line
representing the calculated trend in annual average groundwater levels.
The slope and significance of the trend are given below the title. Red
dots show missing values which were interpolated (see methods).
